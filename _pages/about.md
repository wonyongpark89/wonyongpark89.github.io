I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in [Southampton Education School, University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/southampton-education-school). I serve as a Deputy Chair of the Research Ethics Committee at the Faculty of Social Sciences, and the Ethics Champion for Southampton Education School. My other roles include Associate Editor of [Research in Science Education](https://link.springer.com/journal/11165), Guest Editor of [International Journal of Science Education](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/tsed20) and [Science & Education](https://link.springer.com/journal/11191), Editorial Board Member of [Journal of Research in Science Teaching](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10982736) and [Journal of Science Teacher Education](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/uste20). I also co-chair ESERA's Strand 6 (Interdisciplinarity and Education).

# My Work and Research
My research focuses on the intersections of science, humanities and society in education. I am particularly interested in exploring the role of science and STEM education in building disaster-resilient society in times of various local and global crises. I use interdisciplinary approaches between science and other subjects such as history, citizenship and RE. My projects have been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, Research England, the National Science Foundation, and UNESCO.

# My Background
I grew up in South Korea. After completing my undergraduate degree and teacher training in Physics Education, I received an MSc in Science Education, both at Seoul National University. I taught at secondary schools in Seoul. I then moved to the UK for a DPhil in Science Education at the Department of Education, University of Oxford, from 2018 to 2021. My doctoral project looked at how three science teachers assessed students' knowledge of the nature of science in their classrooms.

# PhD Application
I am keen to hear from prospective PhD students interested in science education and my other areas of research. I do **not** supervise PhDs outside of my expertise. For more information about PhD application, see [this page](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/education).
