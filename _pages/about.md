I am an Associate Professor of Science Education in [Southampton Education School, University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/southampton-education-school). I serve as a Deputy Chair of the Research Ethics Committee at the Faculty of Social Sciences, and the Ethics Champion for Southampton Education School. I am also an Associate Programme Director for [MSc Education](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/education-masters-msc).

I am Associate Editor of [Research in Science Education](https://link.springer.com/journal/11165) and [Journal of Research in Science Teaching](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10982736) (from 2025), Guest Editor of [International Journal of Science Education](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/tsed20) and [Science & Education](https://link.springer.com/journal/11191),and Editorial Board Member of  [Journal of Science Teacher Education](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/uste20). I am a Co-Chair of Strand 12 (Equity, Diversity and Identity in Science Education) of the [European Science Education Research Association](https://www.esera.org/) and an incoming Strand Coordinator for Strand 13 (History, Philosophy, Sociology, and Nature of Science) of [NARST: A Global Organization for Improving Science Teaching and Learning Through Research](https://narst.org/strands).

# My work and research
My research revolves around the intersections of science, humanities and society in education. I am particularly interested in exploring the role of science and STEM education in promoting social justice in times of various local and global crises. I use cross-curricular and interdisciplinary approaches between science and other subjects such as history, citizenship, religious education, and music. <br/>

My projects have been funded by the [Economic and Social Research Council](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/), [Research England](https://www.ukri.org/councils/research-england/), [the National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/), [UNESCO](https://www.unesco.org/en), the [Academy of Korean Studies](https://intl.aks.ac.kr/english/index.do), [the Grenfell Foundation](https://www.grenfellfoundation.org.uk/), and [Ilju Academic and Culture Foundation](https://www.iljufoundation.org/). I am putting together a [Bibliography of Disaster Education](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5106264/bibliography_of_disaster_education/library), a comprehensive list of publications, podcasts, news, policy reports and other sources for researching and teaching about disaster education. For more information, see the [Projects](https://wonyongpark89.github.io/projects/) page.

# My background
I grew up in an industrial coastal city in South Korea. I completed my undergraduate degree and teacher training in physics education and obtained an MSc in science education, both from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/). After teaching in secondary schools in Seoul, I moved to the UK to undertake a DPhil in Science Education at the [Department of Education, University of Oxford](https://www.education.ox.ac.uk/), from 2018 to 2021. In my [doctoral project](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:f117fbd8-6e07-456a-b6ad-92ff74b28d0a), I looked at how three high school science teachers assessed students' knowledge of the nature of science in their classrooms.

# Study with me
I am keen to hear from prospective PhD students interested in science education, STEM education, disaster education and teacher education. I do **not** supervise PhDs outside of my expertise. For more information about PhD application, see [this page](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/education).

# Funded PhD opportunity for 2024-25 entry
I am accepting applications for a fully funded 4 year PhD studentship. Find out more at:
