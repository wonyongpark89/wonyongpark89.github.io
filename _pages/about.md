I am an Associate Professor of Science Education in [Southampton Education School, University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/southampton-education-school). I am a Deputy Chair of the Research Ethics Committee at the Faculty of Social Sciences, and the Ethics Champion for Southampton Education School. I am also an Associate Programme Director for [MSc Education](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/education-masters-msc).

I am Associate Editor of [Research in Science Education](https://link.springer.com/journal/11165), [Journal of Research in Science Teaching](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10982736), and [Journal of Hazard Literacy](https://www.ejhl.org/), and was previously Guest Editor of [International Journal of Science Education](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/tsed20) and [Science & Education](https://link.springer.com/journal/11191). I am Co-Chair of Strand 12 (Equity, Diversity and Identity in Science Education) of the [European Science Education Research Association](https://www.esera.org/) and Co-Coordinator for Strand 13 (History, Philosophy, Sociology, and Nature of Science) of [NARST: A Global Organization for Improving Science Education Through Research](https://narst.org/strands).

# My work and research
My research revolves around the intersections of science, humanities and society in education. I am particularly interested in exploring the role of science and STEM education in promoting social justice in times of various local and global crises. I use cross-curricular and interdisciplinary approaches between science and other subjects such as history, citizenship, religious education, and music. I am also interested in bridging research, policy and practice in science education. <br/>

My projects have been funded by the [Economic and Social Research Council](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/), [Research England](https://www.ukri.org/councils/research-england/), [the National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/), [UNESCO](https://www.unesco.org/en), the [Academy of Korean Studies](https://intl.aks.ac.kr/english/index.do), [the Grenfell Foundation](https://www.grenfellfoundation.org.uk/), and [Ilju Academic and Culture Foundation](https://www.iljufoundation.org/). I am putting together a [Bibliography of Disaster Education](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5106264/bibliography_of_disaster_education/library), a comprehensive list of publications, podcasts, news, policy reports and other sources for researching and teaching about disaster education. To find out more about my recent and current projects, see [Projects](https://wonyongpark89.github.io/projects/).

# My background
I grew up in [an industrial coastal city](https://www.wonyongpark.com/projects/fertility/) in South Korea. I completed my undergraduate degree and teacher training in physics education and obtained an MSc in science education, both from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/). After teaching in secondary schools in Seoul, I moved to the UK to undertake a DPhil in Science Education at the [Department of Education, University of Oxford](https://www.education.ox.ac.uk/), from 2018 to 2021. In my [doctoral project](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:f117fbd8-6e07-456a-b6ad-92ff74b28d0a), I looked at how three high school science teachers assessed students' nature of science understandings in their classrooms.

# Study with me
I am keen to hear from prospective PhD students and postdoctoral scholars interested in science education, physics education, STEM education, disaster education and teacher education. For more information about PhD application, see [this page](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/education). There are competitive PhD funding opportunities to study at the University of Southampton, for example, the [South Coast Doctoral Training Partnership](https://southcoastdtp.ac.uk/) and [other University-based scholarships](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/doctoral-college/presidential-scholarships.page). 

For postdoctoral fellowship opportunities, please see [ESRC SCDTP Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://southcoastdtp.ac.uk/our-people/postdoctoral-fellows/), [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships), [British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/funding/postdoctoral-fellowships/) and [Leverhulme Early Career Fellowships](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/early-career-fellowships).
