This week, the Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission published its final report [Remembering Grenfell: Recommendations and next steps to a memorial](https://www.grenfelltowermemorial.co.uk/report2023). These recommendations are based on the views of survivors, families and residents, as well as case studies of other disaster memorials.

The report devoted two pages to a case study of the Sewol Ferry disaster in Korea. This case study is based on the meeting between Grenfell and Sewol families in London in January 2023, and the visit of Grenfell survivors Hanan Wahabi and Marcio Gomes to Ansan, Korea in June 2023. These exchanges have been supported by the TeachDisasters project.
