I was invited to speak at the conference "Making a Living Archive" to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Sewol ferry disaster. The event was hosted by the 4.16 Institute of Democratic Citizenship Education, and brought together scholars from around the world with backgrounds in history, anthropology, education and memory studies. <!--more-->
