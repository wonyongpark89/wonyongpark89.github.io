This project develops and evaluates a continuing professional development (CPD) course for teachers  with the people affected by the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 in London. Information will be collected from teachers, students and the members of the Grenfell community involved in the project to evidence the projectâ€™s impact.
One of the worst disasters in modern British history that claimed 72 lives, the Grenfell disaster has raised pressing questions about humans, technology, and social justice. 
It brings together expertise in disaster education, values, religions and ethics, and online learning and course development. It also includes substantial input from and collaboration with the Grenfell community at all stages of the project.

## Aims
* To work with disaster-affected communities, organisations, teachers and young people to promote a culture of safety, justice and resilience
* To support teachers to teach about human-made disasters such as Grenfell in an evidence-based and ethically sensitive manner
* To facilitate an intergenerational dialogue about a national tragedy with respect

## Objectives
* To develop a research-informed online CPD course on disaster education using the Grenfell Tower fire as an example, which can be applied to other disasters
* To generate evidence of the impact of the CPD course on UK teachers
* To propose an innovative model of collaboration between researchers and disaster communities for social and cultural change
* To share the experience with other disaster communities within and outside the UK to facilitate mutual learning and solidarity
