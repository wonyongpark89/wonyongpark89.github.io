HEIs and learned societies are key contributors of knowledge and expertise to shaping science education policy, ranging from curriculum reform and diversity through to teacher shortages. While the role of the two sectors is pivotal to the continuous evolution of science education in the UK, the intersection of these two communities of practice has rarely been formally examined. The isolation and lack of engagement between the two can lead to duplication of effort and overly siloed research and practice. Policy actors in learned societies often find research published in academic journals by HEI researchers too abstract, theoretical and high-level; HEI researchers often find policy recommendations from learned societies lacking in theoretical and evidential base. There are clear challenges to collaboration such as horizon mismatch, incentives mismatch, and resistance to change. This project aims to bridge these two sectors to explore future directions for research-informed policy and policy-informed research in science education.

## Aims
* Map out the current landscape of science education policymaking
* Bring together representatives from learned societies and HEI researchers in science education
* Facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experience between the two sectors
* Identify pathways for joint problem discovery and knowledge creation between the two sectors
* Co-develop suggestions to promote research-informed policy and policy-informed research.
