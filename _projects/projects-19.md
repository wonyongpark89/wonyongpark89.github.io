Higher education institutions (HEIs) and learned societies are key contributors of knowledge and expertise to shaping science education policy, ranging from curriculum reform and inclusion through to teacher shortages. While the role of the two sectors is pivotal to the continuous evolution of science education in England, the intersection of these two communities of practice has rarely been formally examined. 

The isolation and lack of engagement between the two can lead to duplication of effort and overly siloed research and practice. Policy actors often find research published in academic journals by HEI researchers too abstract, high-level, and disconnected from practice; HEI researchers often criticise policy recommendations and measures for lacking theoretical and evidentiary underpinnings. There are clear challenges to collaboration such as horizon mismatch, misaligned incentives, and resistance to change. This project aims to bridge these two sectors to explore future directions for research-informed policy and policy-informed research in science education.

The project involves documentary analysis, interviews and knowledge exchange events with policy actors in science education (policymakers, learned societies and researchers) to be held in July 2025.

## Aims
* Map out the current landscape of science education policymaking
* Bring together policy actors from learned societies and HEI researchers in science education
* Facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experience between the two communities
* Identify pathways for joint problem discovery and knowledge creation between the two communities
* Co-develop suggestions to promote research-informed policy and research-policy dialogue
