South Korea’s demographic crisis, characterised by an ageing population and a record-low fertility rate of 0.78 children per woman by 2022, is having a significant impact on the education system. With enrolments declining rapidly, many schools are facing closure or consolidation in order to maintain the quality of education with limited resources. This study examines how these demographic changes affect Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education, focusing on schools in regions with declining populations. 

By examining how demographic shifts affect students’ opportunities to learn STEM subjects and pursue STEM careers, this study aims to explore directions for policy interventions that can turn the demographic crisis into an opportunity.

## Research Questions
1.	How is the demographic decline shifting STEM education in small schools in South Korea?
2.	How does such a change impact students’ opportunities to participate in STEM and pursue STEM careers?
